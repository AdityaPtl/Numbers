# Numbers Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Numbers Projects** repository! This collection focuses on programming challenges that revolve around numerical computations and algorithms. This is part of a broader initiative to deepen my understanding of software engineering fundamentals.

## About This Repo

This repository is inspired by this [Project List](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects) and contains projects related to numerical algorithms and computations. Each project is designed to reinforce problem-solving skills and encourage efficient coding practices.

### Why This Repo?
- **Strengthen Numerical Skills:** Focus on numerical and mathematical challenges to sharpen algorithmic thinking.
- **Portfolio Building:** Develop projects that demonstrate practical coding skills and computational problem-solving.
- **Prepare for Interviews:** Tackle projects that mirror the types of questions and problems found in technical interviews.
